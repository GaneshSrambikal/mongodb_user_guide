* Mongodb indexes are efficient in execution of queries.

* Using Indexes mongodb it limits the number documents to be scanned or inspect,
  that means it do not need to scan the whole document for the specified projection.

* Indexes are special data structures that store a small portion of document data set in a 
  ease-to-traverse form. 

* To create an Index in mongodb use syntax
  db.collection.createIndex({key: 1 / -1}, options)
  here the key is any field from the collection and numbers 1 and -1 are order in which index will be sorted.
  1 is from ascending and -1 is for descending.
  for example:
  db.collection.createIndex({name:1})

* To create in node.js
  collection.createIndex({key:1/-1},function(err,result){
      callback result;
  });
  for example:
  collection.createIndex({address:1},function(err,result){
      callback result;
  });

* Mongodb indexes uses B-tree data structures.

* Mongodb indexes are same as other database system indexes.
