The Insert() Method in MongoDb is used to insert data into the 
mongodb collection.
Syntax:
db.collection.insert(document)

example
db.movies.insert({ratings:4.5})

movies is the collection, if it doesnt exist mongodb will create 
the collection called movies and then insert the document into it.

the _id consist of ObjectId followed by 12 bytes number :-
4 bytes  - timestamp
3 bytes  - Machine ID 
2 bytes  - Process ID
3 bytes  - increment
