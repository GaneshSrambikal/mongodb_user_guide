A Projection parameter selects only the fields/data which is 
needed from the document instead of selecting the whole document.
 
 which simply means the projection parameter determines which fields are returned in the 
 matching documents.
  The projection parameter takes a document of the following
  form:
  { key : value }
  where - key is the field from the document to match.
    and value includes number which 1 or 0 (true or false).
    1 -include the field in the return document .
    0 -excluding the field

A  projection cannot contain both include and exclude specfication.

NOTE: for the _id field, we do not need to explicitly specify 
_id: 1 , the find() method returns _id field unless its specified _id :0 .
 
 Example :
 db.collection_name.find({"title":1,"description":1,_id:0})
