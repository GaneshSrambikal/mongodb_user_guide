Aggregation operations process data records and return computed results.
Aggregation groups the values from mutliple documents together and can 
perform a variety of operations on the grouped data to return a single result.
Aggregation is equivalent of sql count(*) and group by.

to use Aggregation we aggregate()
syntax
db.collection.aggregate(AGGREGATE OPERATION)

FOR EXAMPLE from a document we need to display how many courses does each tutor has created.

db.tutor.aggregate([{$group :{_id:$by_tutor,num_ofcourse:{$sum:1}}])

result will be.
{
   "result" : [
      {
         "_id" : "David",
         "num_ofcourse" : 2
      },
      {
         "_id" : "Doe",
         "num_ofcourse" : 1
      }
   ],
   "ok" : 1
}
