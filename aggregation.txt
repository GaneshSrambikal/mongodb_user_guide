Aggregation operations process data records and return computed results.
Aggregation groups the values from mutliple documents together and can 
perform a variety of operations on the grouped data to return a single result.
Aggregation is equivalent of sql count(*) and group by.

to use Aggregation we aggregate()
syntax
db.collection.aggregate(AGGREGATE OPERATION)

FOR EXAMPLE from a document we need to display how many courses does each tutor has created.

db.tutor.aggregate([{$group :{_id:$by_tutor,num_ofcourse:{$sum:1}}])

result will be.
{ "_id" : "Austin", "num_of_courses" : 1 }
{ "_id" : "David", "num_of_courses" : 3 }
{ "_id" : "John", "num_of_courses" : 1 }
