to create a database in mongodb we use the 'use' command.
* syntax for use command *
use database name

ex. use demo
The use command will create an database called demo.
if the demo database exist it will return the existing db.

to see how many db exists use the following cammand:
show dbs.
this will show all the existing db .

Now you will notice that the db demo is not in the list,
for that we need to insert atleast one document
ex. 
db.info.insert({"name":"Doe"})
the key value pairs will be stored in the info document.

To delete a database use the following command
* db.dropDatabase() *
