In mongoDB data has a flexible schema.documents in the same collection.
they do not neeed to have the same set of structure and fields 
and do not need to have same set of data.

**Note to be considered while desigining a schema in mongoDB

1.Design and optimize schema according to the users requirement.

2.Do joins whike write but not on read.

3.Do complex aggregation in the schema.

4.combine objects into one document if you will use then together.

5. Duplicates the data because disk space is cheap as ascampare to 
    compute time.

Takes an example of post in a blog,where 
* every post has an unique id ,title 
* every post can have multiple tags.
* on each posts there can be no or manylikes and comments.

Here is an example how rdbms would look like,
where there are three tables post ,comment and tag_list.
the post table has 1 to many (1N) relationship ,with tag list and comment

COMMENT N----1 POST 1----N tag list

-----------------   ---------------    ---------------- 
COMMENT             POST                tag_list  
-----------------   ---------------    ----------------
comment_id          id                  id
post_id             title               post_id
by_user             description         tag
body                url
timestamp           likes
likes               post_by


In mongoDB all this will be store in one collection!.
{
    _id: POST_ID
   title: TITLE_OF_POST, 
   description: POST_DESCRIPTION,
   by: POST_BY,
   url: URL_OF_POST,
   tags: [TAG1, TAG2, TAG3],
   likes: TOTAL_LIKES, 
   comments: [	
      {
         user:'COMMENT_BY',
         message: TEXT,
         dateCreated: DATE_TIME,
         like: LIKES 
      },
      {
         user:'COMMENT_BY',
         message: TEXT,
         dateCreated: DATE_TIME,
         like: LIKES
      }
   ]
}
